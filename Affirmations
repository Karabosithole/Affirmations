    Effective pushing often involves poop. Today I will embrace the poop.

    Life would be tragic if it weren’t funny too.

    Live life to the fullest. Wake up and smell the birdsh*t on your windshield.

    I try to see the funny side of every situation.

    Excuse me, I need to go be awesome today.

    Today I’m going to reach for the stars so that I can air out my armpits.

    My future is a golden, sparkly, explosion of f**king awesomeness.
    
    Alexa, clean the negativity off of my mind please.
    
    Who’s that fine ass? Oh, it’s me.

    I believed in Santa Claus for 10 years. I can believe in myself for 5 minutes.

    I keep moving forward even if my pants come off.

    I like my thoughts how I like my whiskey, always glass half full.

    I tried to catch fog yesterday. Mist.

    It’s okay if people don’t like me. Not everyone has good taste.
    
    My funny vibes attract my funny tribe.

    Treat me like a joke and I’ll leave you like it’s funny.

    I’m not insulting you. I’m describing you.

    I’m amusing and make the people around me happy.

    I receive what I believe.

    People who talk behind my back are getting a great view.
